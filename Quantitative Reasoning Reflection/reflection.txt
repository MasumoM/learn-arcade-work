Questions:

1] I used many different methods to make my programs work. in deciing what
methoods to use i looked at ehat i needed to get done and then looked at what
was the best way to do it. i used lists to organise my code to make sure it
makes sense when i go back to it and ananalyse it or when i try to explain
something to someone else which was effective. I used loops to make my code more
seamles and easy to engage with. with loops i was able to eliminate tidious
repetitive coding by just making a list that took the workload out of my hands.
